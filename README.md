Here is a sample README for your GPU_FFT project which outlines the project setup, how to build and run it, and describes the performance analysis tools used:

# GPU_FFT Project

The GPU_FFT project is designed to perform fast Fourier transforms (FFT) on large matrices using CUDA. It includes implementations that leverage different optimization strategies across multiple stages of the FFT computation.

## Requirements

- CMake 3.18 or higher
- CUDA Toolkit (Compatible with your GPU architecture)
- A compatible C++ compiler
- NVIDIA GPU with Compute Capability 7.5 or higher (for specified architectures)

## Building the Project

To build the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Create a build directory and navigate into it:

   ```bash
   mkdir build && cd build
   ```

4. Run CMake configuration and then build the project:

   ```bash
   cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
   make
   ```

This will compile all the necessary executables for both generating matrices and performing FFT operations.

## Running the Project

To run FFT operations:

1. Generate input matrices:

   ```bash
   make create_all_inputs
   ```

2. Execute FFT on a specific matrix size:

   ```bash
   make run_all_1024  # Example for 1024x1024 matrix size
   ```

You can run the project for different stages and sizes by modifying the size in the command.

## Performance Analysis

This project is equipped with NVIDIA's `ncu` tool commands integrated into custom targets for memory transactions, throughput, and cache efficiency analysis. To execute these analyses for a specific implementation (e.g., `fft_stage0`), run:

```bash
make stage0_analysis
```

This will output CSV files containing performance metrics to the `eval_results` directory.

## Benchmarks

To benchmark all small or large matrix sizes, use:

```bash
make benchmark_small
make benchmark_large
```

These commands will run FFTs on all predefined small and large matrix sizes respectively.

## Comprehensive Report

To generate a comprehensive performance report combining all CSV files:

```bash
make generate_report
```

This will concatenate all analysis results into a single CSV file in the `eval_results` directory.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure CUDA and OpenMP packages are correctly installed and configured on your system.
- The project uses CUDA architecture 75 by default, which corresponds to NVIDIA Turing architecture GPUs. Adjust the `CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES` in the CMakeLists file to match your GPU capabilities.
