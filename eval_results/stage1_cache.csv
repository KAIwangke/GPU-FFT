Eligible warps are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused.

A high number of warps waiting at a barrier is commonly caused by diverging code paths before a barrier. This causes some warps to wait a long time until other warps reach the synchronization point. Whenever possible, try to divide up the work into blocks of uniform workloads. If the block size is 512 threads or greater, consider splitting it into smaller groups. This can increase eligible warps without affecting occupancy, unless shared memory becomes a new occupancy limiter. Also, try to identify which barrier instruction causes the most stalls, and optimize the code executed before that synchronization point first.

Eligible warps are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused.

Other reasons include frequent execution of special math instructions (e.g. MUFU) or dynamic branching (e.g. BRX, JMX). Consult the Memory Workload Analysis section to verify if there are shared memory operations and reduce bank conflicts, if reported. Assigning frequently accessed values to variables can assist the compiler in using low-latency registers instead of direct memory accesses.

This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 12 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of 1.95 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 0.04 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of eligible warps, reduce the time the active warps are stalled by inspecting the top stall reasons on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections.","local","95.83"

This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 12 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of 2.01 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 0.05 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of eligible warps, reduce the time the active warps are stalled by inspecting the top stall reasons on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections.","local","95.52"

This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 12 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of 1.99 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 0.05 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of eligible warps, reduce the time the active warps are stalled by inspecting the top stall reasons on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections.","local","95.25"

Other reasons include frequent execution of special math instructions (e.g. MUFU) or dynamic branching (e.g. BRX, JMX). Consult the Memory Workload Analysis section to verify if there are shared memory operations and reduce bank conflicts, if reported. Assigning frequently accessed values to variables can assist the compiler in using low-latency registers instead of direct memory accesses.
