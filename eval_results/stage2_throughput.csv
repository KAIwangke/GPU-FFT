To reduce the number of cycles waiting on L1TEX data accesses verify the memory access patterns are optimal for the target architecture, attempt to increase cache hit rates by increasing data locality (coalescing), or by changing the cache configuration.

To reduce the number of cycles waiting on L1TEX data accesses verify the memory access patterns are optimal for the target architecture, attempt to increase cache hit rates by increasing data locality (coalescing), or by changing the cache configuration.

This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 12 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of 4.95 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 0.01 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp. Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.","local","22.31"

To reduce the number of cycles waiting on L1TEX data accesses verify the memory access patterns are optimal for the target architecture, attempt to increase cache hit rates by increasing data locality (coalescing), or by changing the cache configuration.

The primary reason for a high number of stalls due to short scoreboards is typically memory operations to shared memory. Other reasons include frequent execution of special math instructions (e.g. MUFU) or dynamic branching (e.g. BRX, JMX). Consult the Memory Workload Analysis section to verify if there are shared memory operations and reduce bank conflicts, if reported. Assigning frequently accessed values to variables can assist the compiler in using low-latency registers instead of direct memory accesses.

Eligible warps are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused.

Other reasons include frequent execution of special math instructions (e.g. MUFU) or dynamic branching (e.g. BRX, JMX). Consult the Memory Workload Analysis section to verify if there are shared memory operations and reduce bank conflicts, if reported. Assigning frequently accessed values to variables can assist the compiler in using low-latency registers instead of direct memory accesses.

Consult the Memory Workload Analysis section to verify if there are shared memory operations and reduce bank conflicts, if reported.

Eligible warps are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp. Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.","local","21.05"

The primary reason for a high number of stalls due to short scoreboards is typically memory operations to shared memory. Other reasons include frequent execution of special math instructions (e.g. MUFU) or dynamic branching (e.g. BRX, JMX). Consult the Memory Workload Analysis section to verify if there are shared memory operations and reduce bank conflicts, if reported. Assigning frequently accessed values to variables can assist the compiler in using low-latency registers instead of direct memory accesses.

Eligible warps are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp.

Other reasons include frequent execution of special math instructions (e.g. MUFU) or dynamic branching (e.g. BRX, JMX). Consult the Memory Workload Analysis section to verify if there are shared memory operations and reduce bank conflicts, if reported. Assigning frequently accessed values to variables can assist the compiler in using low-latency registers instead of direct memory accesses.

Eligible warps are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused.

Other reasons include frequent execution of special math instructions (e.g. MUFU) or dynamic branching (e.g. BRX, JMX). Consult the Memory Workload Analysis section to verify if there are shared memory operations and reduce bank conflicts, if reported.

To reduce the number of cycles waiting on L1TEX data accesses verify the memory access patterns are optimal for the target architecture, attempt to increase cache hit rates by increasing data locality (coalescing), or by changing the cache configuration.

The primary reason for a high number of stalls due to short scoreboards is typically memory operations to shared memory. Other reasons include frequent execution of special math instructions (e.g. MUFU) or dynamic branching (e.g. BRX, JMX). Consult the Memory Workload Analysis section to verify if there are shared memory operations and reduce bank conflicts, if reported. Assigning frequently accessed values to variables can assist the compiler in using low-latency registers instead of direct memory accesses.

Eligible warps are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp.

Other reasons include frequent execution of special math instructions (e.g. MUFU) or dynamic branching (e.g. BRX, JMX). Consult the Memory Workload Analysis section to verify if there are shared memory operations and reduce bank conflicts, if reported. Assigning frequently accessed values to variables can assist the compiler in using low-latency registers instead of direct memory accesses.

Eligible warps are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused.

Other reasons include frequent execution of special math instructions (e.g. MUFU) or dynamic branching (e.g. BRX, JMX). Consult the Memory Workload Analysis section to verify if there are shared memory operations and reduce bank conflicts, if reported. Assigning frequently accessed values to variables can assist the compiler in using low-latency registers instead of direct memory accesses.

Eligible warps are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused.

Other reasons include frequent execution of special math instructions (e.g. MUFU) or dynamic branching (e.g. BRX, JMX). Consult the Memory Workload Analysis section to verify if there are shared memory operations and reduce bank conflicts, if reported. Assigning frequently accessed values to variables can assist the compiler in using low-latency registers instead of direct memory accesses.

To reduce the number of cycles waiting on L1TEX data accesses verify the memory access patterns are optimal for the target architecture, attempt to increase cache hit rates by increasing data locality (coalescing), or by changing the cache configuration.
