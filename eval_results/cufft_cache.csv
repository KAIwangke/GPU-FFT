Out of the maximum of 12 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of 7.74 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 1.16 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp. Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.","local","45.44"

Out of the maximum of 12 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of 3.72 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 0.36 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp. Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.","local","57.21"

Try to avoid using thread-local memory by checking if dynamically indexed arrays are declared in local scope, of if the kernel has excessive register pressure causing by spills. If applicable, consider combining multiple lower-width memory operations into fewer wider memory operations and try interleaving memory operations and math instructions.
