Whenever possible, try to divide up the work into blocks of uniform workloads. If the block size is 512 threads or greater, consider splitting it into smaller groups. This can increase eligible warps without affecting occupancy, unless shared memory becomes a new occupancy limiter.

Other reasons include frequent execution of special math instructions (e.g. MUFU) or dynamic branching (e.g. BRX, JMX). Consult the Memory Workload Analysis section to verify if there are shared memory operations and reduce bank conflicts, if reported. Assigning frequently accessed values to variables can assist the compiler in using low-latency registers instead of direct memory accesses.

Find the instruction producing the data being waited upon to identify the culprit. To reduce the number of cycles waiting on L1TEX data accesses verify the memory access patterns are optimal for the target architecture, attempt to increase cache hit rates by increasing data locality (coalescing), or by changing the cache configuration. Consider moving frequently used data to shared memory. This stall type represents about 41.4% of the total average of 45.0 cycles between issuing two instructions.","global","41.45"

To reduce the number of cycles waiting on L1TEX data accesses verify the memory access patterns are optimal for the target architecture, attempt to increase cache hit rates by increasing data locality (coalescing), or by changing the cache configuration.

Find the instruction producing the data being waited upon to identify the culprit. To reduce the number of cycles waiting on L1TEX data accesses verify the memory access patterns are optimal for the target architecture, attempt to increase cache hit rates by increasing data locality (coalescing), or by changing the cache configuration. Consider moving frequently used data to shared memory. This stall type represents about 41.7% of the total average of 42.7 cycles between issuing two instructions.","global","41.69"

The primary reason for a high number of stalls due to short scoreboards is typically memory operations to shared memory. Other reasons include frequent execution of special math instructions (e.g. MUFU) or dynamic branching (e.g. BRX, JMX). Consult the Memory Workload Analysis section to verify if there are shared memory operations and reduce bank conflicts, if reported. Assigning frequently accessed values to variables can assist the compiler in using low-latency registers instead of direct memory accesses. This stall type represents about 40.9% of the total average of 41.2 cycles between issuing two instructions.","global","40.89"
