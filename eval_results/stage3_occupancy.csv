Eligible warps are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp.

The primary reason for a high number of stalls due to short scoreboards is typically memory operations to shared memory. Other reasons include frequent execution of special math instructions (e.g. MUFU) or dynamic branching (e.g. BRX, JMX). Consult the Memory Workload Analysis section to verify if there are shared memory operations and reduce bank conflicts, if reported. Assigning frequently accessed values to variables can assist the compiler in using low-latency registers instead of direct memory accesses.

The primary reason for a high number of stalls due to short scoreboards is typically memory operations to shared memory. Other reasons include frequent execution of special math instructions (e.g. MUFU) or dynamic branching (e.g. BRX, JMX). Consult the Memory Workload Analysis section to verify if there are shared memory operations and reduce bank conflicts, if reported. Assigning frequently accessed values to variables can assist the compiler in using low-latency registers instead of direct memory accesses. This stall type represents about 79.2% of the total average of 29.4 cycles between issuing two instructions.","global","24.16"

Eligible warps are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp.

The primary reason for a high number of stalls due to short scoreboards is typically memory operations to shared memory. Other reasons include frequent execution of special math instructions (e.g. MUFU) or dynamic branching (e.g. BRX, JMX). Consult the Memory Workload Analysis section to verify if there are shared memory operations and reduce bank conflicts, if reported. Assigning frequently accessed values to variables can assist the compiler in using low-latency registers instead of direct memory accesses.

Other reasons include frequent execution of special math instructions (e.g. MUFU) or dynamic branching (e.g. BRX, JMX). Consult the Memory Workload Analysis section to verify if there are shared memory operations and reduce bank conflicts, if reported. Assigning frequently accessed values to variables can assist the compiler in using low-latency registers instead of direct memory accesses.

This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 12 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of 2.67 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 0.10 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp. Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.","local","24.27"

The primary reason for a high number of stalls due to short scoreboards is typically memory operations to shared memory. Other reasons include frequent execution of special math instructions (e.g. MUFU) or dynamic branching (e.g. BRX, JMX). Consult the Memory Workload Analysis section to verify if there are shared memory operations and reduce bank conflicts, if reported. Assigning frequently accessed values to variables can assist the compiler in using low-latency registers instead of direct memory accesses. This stall type represents about 79.2% of the total average of 29.4 cycles between issuing two instructions.","global","24.27"

Other reasons include frequent execution of special math instructions (e.g. MUFU) or dynamic branching (e.g. BRX, JMX). Consult the Memory Workload Analysis section to verify if there are shared memory operations and reduce bank conflicts, if reported. Assigning frequently accessed values to variables can assist the compiler in using low-latency registers instead of direct memory accesses.

Other reasons include frequent execution of special math instructions (e.g. MUFU) or dynamic branching (e.g. BRX, JMX). Consult the Memory Workload Analysis section to verify if there are shared memory operations and reduce bank conflicts, if reported.

This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 12 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of 2.67 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 0.10 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp. Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.","local","24.14"

The primary reason for a high number of stalls due to short scoreboards is typically memory operations to shared memory. Other reasons include frequent execution of special math instructions (e.g. MUFU) or dynamic branching (e.g. BRX, JMX). Consult the Memory Workload Analysis section to verify if there are shared memory operations and reduce bank conflicts, if reported. Assigning frequently accessed values to variables can assist the compiler in using low-latency registers instead of direct memory accesses. This stall type represents about 79.2% of the total average of 29.4 cycles between issuing two instructions.","global","24.14"

Eligible warps are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused.

Other reasons include frequent execution of special math instructions (e.g. MUFU) or dynamic branching (e.g. BRX, JMX). Consult the Memory Workload Analysis section to verify if there are shared memory operations and reduce bank conflicts, if reported. Assigning frequently accessed values to variables can assist the compiler in using low-latency registers instead of direct memory accesses.

Other reasons include frequent execution of special math instructions (e.g. MUFU) or dynamic branching (e.g. BRX, JMX). Consult the Memory Workload Analysis section to verify if there are shared memory operations and reduce bank conflicts, if reported.

Out of the maximum of 12 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of 2.65 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 0.07 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp. Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.","local","40.16"

The primary reason for a high number of stalls due to short scoreboards is typically memory operations to shared memory. Other reasons include frequent execution of special math instructions (e.g. MUFU) or dynamic branching (e.g. BRX, JMX). Consult the Memory Workload Analysis section to verify if there are shared memory operations and reduce bank conflicts, if reported. Assigning frequently accessed values to variables can assist the compiler in using low-latency registers instead of direct memory accesses. This stall type represents about 72.9% of the total average of 37.5 cycles between issuing two instructions.","global","40.16"

Eligible warps are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused.

The primary reason for a high number of stalls due to short scoreboards is typically memory operations to shared memory. Other reasons include frequent execution of special math instructions (e.g. MUFU) or dynamic branching (e.g. BRX, JMX). Consult the Memory Workload Analysis section to verify if there are shared memory operations and reduce bank conflicts, if reported. Assigning frequently accessed values to variables can assist the compiler in using low-latency registers instead of direct memory accesses.

Other reasons include frequent execution of special math instructions (e.g. MUFU) or dynamic branching (e.g. BRX, JMX). Consult the Memory Workload Analysis section to verify if there are shared memory operations and reduce bank conflicts, if reported.

Eligible warps are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp. Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.","local","40.22"

The primary reason for a high number of stalls due to short scoreboards is typically memory operations to shared memory. Other reasons include frequent execution of special math instructions (e.g. MUFU) or dynamic branching (e.g. BRX, JMX). Consult the Memory Workload Analysis section to verify if there are shared memory operations and reduce bank conflicts, if reported. Assigning frequently accessed values to variables can assist the compiler in using low-latency registers instead of direct memory accesses. This stall type represents about 73.0% of the total average of 37.4 cycles between issuing two instructions.","global","40.22"

Eligible warps are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp.

The primary reason for a high number of stalls due to short scoreboards is typically memory operations to shared memory. Other reasons include frequent execution of special math instructions (e.g. MUFU) or dynamic branching (e.g. BRX, JMX). Consult the Memory Workload Analysis section to verify if there are shared memory operations and reduce bank conflicts, if reported. Assigning frequently accessed values to variables can assist the compiler in using low-latency registers instead of direct memory accesses.

Other reasons include frequent execution of special math instructions (e.g. MUFU) or dynamic branching (e.g. BRX, JMX). Consult the Memory Workload Analysis section to verify if there are shared memory operations and reduce bank conflicts, if reported.

Out of the maximum of 12 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of 2.64 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 0.07 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp. Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.","local","39.93"

The primary reason for a high number of stalls due to short scoreboards is typically memory operations to shared memory. Other reasons include frequent execution of special math instructions (e.g. MUFU) or dynamic branching (e.g. BRX, JMX). Consult the Memory Workload Analysis section to verify if there are shared memory operations and reduce bank conflicts, if reported. Assigning frequently accessed values to variables can assist the compiler in using low-latency registers instead of direct memory accesses. This stall type represents about 73.0% of the total average of 37.4 cycles between issuing two instructions.","global","39.93"

Eligible warps are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused.

The primary reason for a high number of stalls due to short scoreboards is typically memory operations to shared memory. Other reasons include frequent execution of special math instructions (e.g. MUFU) or dynamic branching (e.g. BRX, JMX). Consult the Memory Workload Analysis section to verify if there are shared memory operations and reduce bank conflicts, if reported. Assigning frequently accessed values to variables can assist the compiler in using low-latency registers instead of direct memory accesses.

Other reasons include frequent execution of special math instructions (e.g. MUFU) or dynamic branching (e.g. BRX, JMX). Consult the Memory Workload Analysis section to verify if there are shared memory operations and reduce bank conflicts, if reported.

Out of the maximum of 12 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of 2.65 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 0.07 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp. Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.","local","39.54"

The primary reason for a high number of stalls due to short scoreboards is typically memory operations to shared memory. Other reasons include frequent execution of special math instructions (e.g. MUFU) or dynamic branching (e.g. BRX, JMX). Consult the Memory Workload Analysis section to verify if there are shared memory operations and reduce bank conflicts, if reported. Assigning frequently accessed values to variables can assist the compiler in using low-latency registers instead of direct memory accesses. This stall type represents about 72.8% of the total average of 37.5 cycles between issuing two instructions.","global","39.54"
